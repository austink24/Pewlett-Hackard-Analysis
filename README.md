# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
In this project we are asked to organized PH's data. We will capture and organize the data, turning it into a database that is eay to access and export needed data. 
The data we organized is centered around PH's employees, the departments they work in, date of birth, hire date, salaries, and job titles. We were asked to identify employees who could be retiring soon along with their titles, to help with planning to restaff those positions. 

## Results:
Tools we used to complete this request are:

- .csv files containing the data
- PostgresSQL
- VSCODE and QuickDBD
- PgAdmin

We started by reviewing the data we would use for our analysis, looking at data types and columns. We then used QBD to create the database ERD or Entity Relationhsip Diagram. Once our ERD was complete we used it to build our database using PgAdmin. We wrote PostgreSQL queries to create the tables that we would use to store our data, assigning Primary and foriegn Keys based on the structure outlined in our ERD. 




There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)

## Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
